# Grab AI Challenge - Computer Vision
## Automated Object Detection and Identification
An implementation of the FastAI Object Detection on the Stanford Cars Dataset for the Grab AI Challenge (Computer Vision Category)

Grab AI Challege - Computer Vision
Automated Car Detail Recognition
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given a dataset of distinct car images, can we automatically recognize the car model and make? 

Larger Objective: 
How can we help passengers find their rides quicker and in turn increase earning opportunities for our driver-partners by automating the process of digitizing & understanding imagery on the highest possible quality?

Data set: Cars Dataset from Stanford University 
Details: 18,185 images of 196 classes of cars 
Training Images: 8,144 
Testing Images: 8,041 
Classes: Make, Model, Year (e.g., 2012 Tesla model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe)

The solution is inspired by the Object Detection Technique discussed in the Fast.ai lesson by Jeremy Howard.
